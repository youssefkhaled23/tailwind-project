### Tailwind CSS Configuration

Tailwind CSS is configured in the `tailwind.config.js` file. You can customize your design system, add new utilities, and extend the framework's default styles.
  
```js
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', './public/index.html'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

### Adding New Dependencies

To add a new dependency, use:

```bash
npm install <package-name>
```

And to remove a dependency:

```bash
npm uninstall <package-name>
```

## Build

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build in the `dist` directory. You can deploy the contents of this directory to your preferred hosting platform.
